# what is this?

A little "jump over stuff" game. Written in js (es2015). Thanks to Electron, this game can be played on windows, mac and linux. I used the object composition approach for [jumper](https://github.com/kimhogeling/js-electron-jump-game/blob/master/src/jumper.js) and [mover](https://github.com/kimhogeling/js-electron-jump-game/blob/master/src/mover.js) and I like it! Also [haml](https://github.com/kimhogeling/js-electron-jump-game/blob/master/src/index.haml) rocks :guitar: All the components are modules via `module.exports`.
