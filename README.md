# what is this?

A little "jump over stuff" game. Written in js (es2015). Thanks to Electron, this game can be played on windows, mac and linux. I used the object composition approach for `jumper` and `mover` and I like it!

# get started

1. download and install the internet: `npm install`
2. start the game: `npm start` :tada:

# controls
* any key
* or click
* cmd q to quit
